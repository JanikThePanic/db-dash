i use weaviate a lot at work but theres no good local gui

so heres a vibe-coded frontend + my python backend for it

## setup

just run it as a docker container

(make sure your weaviate instance is running first and is exposed to a port)

```bash
```

## sample weaviate instance

want to just demo the app?

you can run a sample weaviate instance with some fake data like so:

```bash
```
